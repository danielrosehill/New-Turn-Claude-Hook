# Idea for a New Task Hook in Agentic CLI

**Transcribed:** 31 Dec 2025 18:49

**Description:** The user dictates an idea for a hook that automatically identifies when to start a new task and conversation within agentic CLIs like Claude. The hook would use a lightweight agent to determine if the current context is helpful or if a new conversation should be initiated.

## Raw Transcript (Verbatim)

Okay, continuing with my uh spree one-person hackathon today of um little things that I love to add and ideas that I'm just quickly capturing for uh for development. Um in the fu at a indefinite point in time, I think that I need to have a sort of sorting layer after the uh these kind of staging repositories, but um I can work on that uh in time. This one would be incredibly uh useful. So, I have in a couple of different frameworks uh planned out some way for task management that when you're trying to work on a number of discrete tasks with an AI agent, the key to success and the key to, um, not running into context as a wall is in to a large extent, knowing when to start over with a new conversation, a new session. And that's a unique form of context management that is distinct from um, context window pruning, which also has an important place, because that's fully automatic, but that can be very limiting as well. Um, my idea here is I haven't really explored, I've explored lots of the parts of the cloud code ecosystem, uh system, sub-agents, skills, plugins, and the ones I haven't got to yet are actually skills mostly and hooks. And this, I'm not sure whether this could be implemented in cloud code. Another agentic CLI, I don't know whether it has already been implemented, but, um, I'm always earning on the side of sharing the ideas, um, whether it helps me to find something that does exist among the sea of AI projects or it provides the the ground for creating something myself. My idea is that if I'm working on a chat in uh Claude or any agentic IDE for that matter or conversation. Um I just I some I commonly find myself sometimes, these are just habits I've developed through extensive use of these tools, saying, wait, this should be a new, I should start a new conversation. Um what I'm my thinking process there is if I were to spell it out, would be something like this. Okay, the prior context in this chat is not is not helpful for this next request. Therefore, it's bloat. Therefore, this is a good point to clean the context window by starting this what I was just about to send as a new task. Now my idea for a hook is something that would actually offload that effort entirely. What it would be, or the way I'm thinking this could this could be implemented, is as following. It would have to be an incredibly lightweight agent, whose only task is to respond in binary to the question: should this conversation be, should this message from the user be appended to the existing conversation? One, or should it be a new conversation, option two. Now, as I say that, I realize there's a bit of a flaw here. The flaw is that really, it needs to do more than that. It really needs to kind of look at the conversation and say, what it's really trying to do is is answer that question, is the prior context helpful? If it is, let it continue, if it's not, enforce a break. Um, it would definitely be challenging to find a way to add this layer in as a totally automated hook that is not even um seen by the user without slowing down the chat interface significantly, but that's pretty much the idea. Um so that I could carry on with Claude or whatever the case may be. I'm chatting and if the hook triggers, let's say I'm working on, what was it? I'm working on my cloud code index and um I just asked it to check, use GitHub MCP to check if I missed anything. It did that very successfully using an MCP. And I was, what I did here differently was I was going to tag it on as a request to my existing thread. So, what it would look like I think from a user's standpoint is it could be implemented as firstly there's a message like starting new task. It could be a recommendation. I think this should start, is it okay to start this as a new task? Or I advise starting this as a new task. User confirms. You user in the you user in the loop. Um it could be a mode setting. Again, I record this and jot this down thinking that knowing that it's it's a complicated, it's a, it would be a challenging thing to do. If it could be done at all, my suspicion is that this would be a great task for a small model. Um very efficient model that just can in a snap scoop up the text. Very, it's an instruction model that just makes that one decision, sends it back to the uh orchestration framework as binary 1-0 and then the the framework. So it's a it's a it's a front-end component essentially. It's a front-end logic gate. That is the idea. And two things really in this repository: number one, as my motto is don't start from scratch what doesn't need to be starting start starting from scratch. And part two is if you have an idea and someone's hopefully done it better, use use their software. So I want to just do a quick checking against both of those criteria. Otherwise, I'll leave this as a sort of planning idea to to sit and simmer for when I next uh want to pick it up.
